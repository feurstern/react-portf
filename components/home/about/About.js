              Anyway thanks for your interest to look up my profile. My name is
              Muhammad Rio Kurniawan, usually people called me as Rio. I am tech
              and language enthusiast. So in order to realize my dream to become
              a decent developer, I have been working and learning for that for
              almost 3 years. My main focus in the field of game development,
              web developement through portfolio and learning. So far I have a
              decent skill for game development, web developement, and basic

             I am currently working as a Frontend developement for private company in West Jakarta.
             The stack that I used are HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind, bootstrap, NextJS, CodeIgniter-3.
             My main task is to create the clients side and implement the REST-API by using AlpineJS and mostly by using AJAX.
             Sometimes I was being asked to trace the bug, and I have to fix it for backend side one.

              become.
