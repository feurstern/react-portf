             Anyway thanks for your interest to look up my profile. My name is Muhammad
             Rio Kurniawan, usually people called me as Rio. I am tech and language enthusiast.
             So in order to realize my dream to become a decent developer, I have been working and learning for that
             for almost 2 years. My main focus in the field of game development, web developement through portfolio
             and learning. So far I have a decent skill for web  game development(C#, Unity)
             game developement such as HTML, CSS(Tailwind), JS(React, NextJS, NodeJS), I am typical person which never satisfy
             with my skill, and I do reckon my skill is still nothing to compare.
